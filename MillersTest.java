   This class is called the MillerTest Class and provides the main method for your program.
   This program shows polymorphism by applying a method to objects of different classes. 
   Note that in your program, the Users should be prompted to input hours done worked by each miller. 
   You must implement using an array. 
   The order of the workers in the output is Consultants, Employees and Supervisors.
   Use the names in the output sample file provided for you.
